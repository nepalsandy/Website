  <h3>Nepal Tourist Seasons Information</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="compress">Trekking in Nepal can be undertaken throughout the year depending on the region.
  The year is divided into 4 different seasons in Nepal and each season has its distinct attraction to offer for trekking.
</p>
  <p class="compress">Autumn (Sept-Nov):</p>
  <p class="compress">This is the time when you can expect better visibility, the air is fresh, and the weather is perfect and that the Nepalese most important festivals (Dashain and Tihar) are marked during this season The best season offering excellent weather and tantalizing mountain views.
    </p>

  <p class="compress">Winter (Dec-Feb):</p>
  <p class="compress">This season is noted for occasional snowfall and the air can be quite cold at higher elevations. Hence it is ideal for trekking at lower elevations, generally below 3000 meters and offers tantalizing mountain views.
</p>
  <p class="compress">Spring (March-May):</p>
<p class="compress">  Trekking in spring is particularly lovely as the mountain slopes are covered with beautiful and colorful flowers and still have plenty of high snow to enhance your photos. The temperature is quite moderate and the mountain views are excellent.
</p>
<p class="compress">  Summer (June-Aug):</p>
  <p class="compress">This is the favorite season to trek in the rain shadow areas like Upper Mustang, Dolpo and Kailash. This season is also recommended for forest researchers and botanist.
</p>
<div class="travel">
  <h3>Altitude Sickness Information</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="compress">When trekking in Nepal Himalayas “Altitude related Problems” are the important factors to be considered because there is always a real danger of mild to serious problems related to altitude and it is important that trekkers understand that they will be affected to a greater or lesser extent when they ascend to altitudes over about 3000 meters. Altitude sickness, often known as Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) and it means the effect of altitude on those who ascend too rapidly to elevation above 3000 meters. The victim can develop severe symptoms very rapidly if the mild effects are ignored.
</p>
  <p class="compress">I advise my clients to remember the following suggestion when you are on trekking in the high altitude areas above 3000 meters. The following are the basic symptoms of the altitude sickness and to avoid such sickness I recommend few important points.
</p>
<p class="compress"> Basic Symptoms :</p>
<p class="compress">(I) Loss of appetite</p>
<p class="compress">(II) Sleep disturbance</p>
<p class="compress">(III) Difficult to pass urine</p>
  <p class="compress">Medium Symptoms :</p>
  <p class="compress">(I) Headache which is bad</p>
  <p class="compress">(II) Irregular breathing</p>
  <p class="compress">(III) Nausea</p>
  <p class="compress">(IV) Mild weakness</p>
  <p class="compress">Serious Symptoms :</p>
  <p class="compress">(I) Slight swelling of hands and face</p>
  <p class="compress">(II) Cannot stand upright without swaying while eyes are closed.</p>
  <p class="compress">(III) Can hear gurgling sound in the chest.</p>
  <p class="compress">(IV) Zero energy.</p>
  <p class="compress">I want to request my clients that please feel free to discuss any kind of trouble with me whether it is simply gastro-intestinal or altitude related.
</p>
<p class="compress">  What to do about Altitude Sickness ?</p>
  <p class="compress">Altitude illness can be prevented by acclimatization; that is, by a graduate rate of ascent (not more than 400 – 500 meters), allowing sufficient rest at various intermediate altitudes. The dry air of the mountains tends to dehydrate you so an increased fluid intake is necessary. Try to drink at least four liters of water a day. On the trail you can drink hot garlic soup that will help you to some extent. When we reach to our destination it is better to make some hiking up to a bit higher point and come down to the camp or hotel. This is a really good way to get acclimatization. You may take a Diamox 250mg tablets the night before flying / going to altitude. After the symptoms will often disappear and the trek can be resumed.
</p>
  <p class="compress">If you feel obviously suffering from the serious symptoms of AMS then descent should not be delayed even if it means going down in dark. In such case, should an emergency situation arise, horse, or porter will be arranged; or I myself carry you and run to lower (descend) altitudes. There are 3 radios in Namche Bazaar, Doctors at Khunde hospital in the Everest Area and HRA Clinics and in some trekking areas also has the Gamow Bag. The hospital or the clinic will take fees or charges for such services. I can arrange for immediate evacuation, by horse or helicopter, depending on the severity of the case.

  <h3>Health and Medicine Information</h3>
</div>
<p class="compress">  Trekking in Nepal need not be considered a risky affair as far as your health is concerned. Nevertheless, preventive measures such as a thorough medical check up and inoculations before you start trekking can save you from unexpected hazards. Since the remote places of Nepal are not supplied with necessities that are essential for modern medical treatment, and the rescue and evacuation procedures are usually measured in days, it is imperative to make a comprehensive First Aid Kit consisting of basic drugs and accessories as part of your gear for trekking. Various trekking guide books and the pamphlet published by the Himalayan Rescue Association give you detailed information and a complete list of medical supplies. These guide books are easily available in the book shops of Kathmandu. In case of serious illness or injury, prompt evacuation to Kathmandu (or Bangkok, Thailand if possible) is the best remedy. Modern dentistry is unknown in the hills of Nepal, so it is advised to have a checkup before departure from home. Tooth fillings sometimes loosen in cold temperatures and at high altitudes, so it is recommended to have them checked.
</p>
<p class="compress">  The following information is not intended to be a comprehensive medical guide; neither will medications and their use be discussed in any detail. Please consult your physician and get a complete check – up before your departure. Make sure that you are well prepared for the trek since lack of fitness can often lead to discomfort or illness. Something as simple as a foot blister can totally ruin a trek, not only for you but also for your companion. The vast majority of diseases that plague the trekker in Nepal are transmitted by food or water contaminated by infected human or animal. We Nepalese can drink water directly from the water tap without filtering, boiling because we used to. But you should assume that all water and uncooked foods in Nepal are infected. To make yourself an expert on health aspects of Nepal would not only be difficult but also troublesome. However, one should have some knowledge on Acute Mountain Sickness ( AMA) , Diarrhea, Giar-dia, Dysentery, Cholera, Hepatitis, Rabies, Typhoid, Tetanus, Meningitis, Diphtheria, Malaria and HIV/ AIDS. Common sense can often save lives.
